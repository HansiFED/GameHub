A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

This was our Cross-Course Project (Design, HTML & CSS) where we would implement what we had learned from Design, HTML and CSS. We got the option of choosing between either RainyDays (outside clothing website), GameHub (video game website) or SquareEyes (movie and film website). 
I chose to go with GameHub, as it was what I felt the most connected to (being a gamer myself). I took some inspiration from all the big name's in the market like steam, epic games and the list goes on. Then I combined them into sort of like a hybrid of them all and I must say I'm very pleased with the result. 
The problem I've felt with all of those mentioned above is that either they are way too cluttered or there is way too little information to be found or you have to navigate in a frustrating way to get where you want. 

But to summarize, probably one of the designs I'm the most happy with during my first year at noroff, as I am a sucker for minimalism and contrast.
